# Hello, I am Ethan Olsen.

I am a full-stack web developer from the Pacific Northwest. I am dedicated to creating websites with the latest web technologies. I have a hunger to always be learning so all of my products will have the hottest and most effective tools for the job. I have over a year of HTML/CSS and JavaScript experience along with some passion projects in Python and C++. If you are interested in working together or just want to talk send me a message.

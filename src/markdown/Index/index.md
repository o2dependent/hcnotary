# Welcome to Hood Canal Mobile  Notary Services, LLC

"I come to you!" 

***Call or text 360-205-5969***

Are you in need of a notary public? Do you need something notarized last minute? I'm here to help! I provide professional mobile notary services to individuals and businesses in Mason County and the surrounding areas.

What type of identification do I need to have available for my notary appointment? Any of these:

* A drivers license
* A passport 
* A government issued identification card

***COVID-19 Protocol for appointments:*** masks and social distancing is encouraged. Supplies are disinfected prior to the appointment. Hand sanitizer will be available for use.

***Fees:***

Basic, non loan related fee for a single notarization is $10 (WAC 308-30-220). Please note, this fee is *per person* signing.

Travel fees are in addition to fees for notarial acts calculated on location. Base travel rate is $25. If the location is outside of Belfair, WA there is an additional $0.50 per mile. 

If requested, I can provide you with a free no obligation quote.

To be sensitive to scheduling needs, if I have to wait more than 15 minutes for a confirmed appointment, a $30 fee will be added.

If I go to the confirmed appointment and the notarization is unable to proceed for any reason the travel fee will still be charged.

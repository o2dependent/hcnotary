# About.

I have been doing web design and development for over a year and have found the journey to be overwhelmingly delightful. I went to university for Biology and found later in my academic career that I need a profession that will be more creatively fulfilling. After a friend introduced me to coding I went down the rabbit hole of web development and haven't looked back.

While I do some back end dev work, a majority of my skills are focused on refining my front end and design workflow to create clean, responsive, and easy to use products. My UI / UX skills have been growing at a rapid rate due to my passion for usability and design. By no means am I the best, but I strive toward this every day.

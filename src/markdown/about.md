# About.

My name is Ethan Olsen I am a full stack developer from the Pacific Northwest. I have been doing web design and development for over a year and have found the journey to be overwhelmingly delightful. I went to university for Biology and found later in my academic career that I need a profession that will be more creatively fulfilling. After a friend introduced me to coding I went down the rabbit hole of web development and haven't looked back.

I have experimented with a few tech stacks (MERN, JAM, and LAMP) and found that JAMstack is by far my favorite for freelance development. Using static site generators like Gatsby cuts down development time by eliminating some of the more tedious work. Utilizing Gatsby's plugin system, Netlifly's hosting, and Git-based content management allows for some of the cheapest sites to deploy.

While I do some back end dev work, a majority of my skills are focused on refining my front end and design workflow to create clean, responsive, and easy to use products. My UI / UX skills have been growing at a rapid rate due to my passion for usability and design. By no means am I the best, but I strive toward this every day.

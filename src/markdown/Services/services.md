# Services.

My freelance work primarily focuses on small business and personal portfolio sites, but I have project experience in utility and microservice development as well. My focus in my work is assuring that my clients will have an easy-to-use site.

I have extensive experience in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React. My experience in these technologies in combination with my design expertise allows for fast design and development time. There is no project too large to tackle and learn from. If you are interested in having a site made or working on a project together send me a message!

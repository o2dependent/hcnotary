#Services.

I have extensive experience in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript frameworks such as React. My experience in CSS/HTML and Figma aids in the creation of accessible and visually appealing web and application design. There is no project too large to tackle and learn from.

My freelance work primarily focus' on small business and personal portfolio sites, but I have project experience in utility development as well. My focus in my work is assuring that the client will have an easy to use and edit site. If you are interested in having a site made or working on a project together send me a message!
